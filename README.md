# bababui :robot: :monkey:
Meet bababui, a discord bot that answers your voice commands. 
![bababui selfie](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Bababui selfie")

Why bababui? The name sounds cool. And since it makes me think of a monkey it was baptized as such.

## Usage
Write `!join` on a text channel to make the bot **appear** on your voice channel (you must be in one). After an initial 'hello' message it will be available to answer your voice commands!

To **issue a command** you must say `monkey <cmd> <args>*`. You can try `monkey help` to learn the available commands.

For the bot to **leave** the channel you can either write `!leave` or say `monkey leave`.
